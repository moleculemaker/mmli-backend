0	0	Particular focus is placed on the use of enantiomerically enriched organoboron compounds as coupling partners in stereospecific processes, as well as the development of enantioconvergent and group-selective reactions.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	1	290	1232	1219	1445
1	1	At the time, the only precedent for enantiospecific Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling was found in cyclopropylated substrates.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	1	1354	1153	2352	1283
2	2	The cross-coupling of larger alicyclic compounds was described subsequently and independently by Fu, 14 Molander, 15 and van den Hoogenband 16 (Chart 1).	Paper3_Perspective_2017	1	1352	1611	2350	1742
3	3	The oxidative sensitivity of more electron rich alkylated phosphines to stoichiometric Ag 2 O limited the number of phosphine ligands that could be screened.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	2	252	557	1256	743
4	4	23 Allylic boronic esters were also shown to undergo crosscoupling.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	2	1354	562	2350	647
5	5	However, allylic boronic esters have the added complication of providing a mixture of S E and S E ′ products.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	2	1352	797	2356	922
6	6	However, when the allyl unit is part of a styrenyl system, a higher proportion of direct coupling without allylic transposition is observed.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	2	1352	1945	2352	2169
7	7	Morken employed unsymmetrical terminally disubstituted allylic boranes in this reaction, leading to quaternary centers with control of stereochemistry.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	3	252	473	1252	604
8	8	In a related 2013 report, the Buchwald group described the cross-coupling of terminally substituted allylboronates with aryl halides.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	3	252	1704	1252	1829
9	9	The Hall group has described the cross-coupling of allylic boronic esters contained within heterocyclic frameworks, specifically compounds of types 18 and 21, prepared using enantioselective borylation of achiral cyclic enol ethers and enamines.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	3	252	1938	1252	2150
10	10	29 Substrates 18 and 21 were shown to undergo stereoretentive cross-couplings with high γ-selectivities when XPhos was employed as the ligand, yielding products 20 and 23.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	3	252	2113	1252	2289
11	11	Propargylic boronic esters also undergo stereospecific crosscoupling reactions, as demonstrated by the Aggarwal group.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	3	1354	474	2350	559
12	12	This problem was solved through the use of smaller substituents on boron.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	3	1353	2362	2352	2447
13	13	33 Interestingly, under different conditions, the Liao group subsequently showed that cross-coupling of closely related dibenzylic potassium trifluoroborate salts with aryl triflates occurs with inversion of stereochemistry using a Pd(OAc) 2 / PCy 3 catalyst system.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	4	253	1578	1252	1942
14	14	Although the presence of the adjacent π-system undoubtedly accelerates the reaction by weakening of the B-C bond, this is not the only effect; otherwise coupling of, for example, organoborane 6 would occur under traditional conditions and not require the presence of silver oxide to promote transmetalation.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	4	252	2316	1253	2584
15	15	Carbonyl-Directed Couplings.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	4	295	2956	838	2995
16	16	Suginome and Ohmura 35 were the first to demonstrate this when they showed that boronic ester 31 underwent SM crosscoupling with high levels of enantiospecificity (Scheme 5).	Paper3_Perspective_2017	4	1352	696	2350	834
17	17	It was proposed that in this case, Journal of the American Chemical Society transmetalation occurs from a structure not involving amide coordination to boron (31′) which transmetalates to Pd via a four-membered cyclic transition state with retention of configuration (Scheme 5).	Paper3_Perspective_2017	5	252	202	1256	500
18	18	The fact that the coupling occurs at all after removing the coordinating ability of the amide carbonyl is notable, given the general resistance of crowded boronic esters such as 31 to cross-coupling, although the benzylic nature of the substrate certainly assists in the overall transformation.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	5	252	425	1252	683
19	19	37a The substrates for these transformations could be readily prepared by Rh-catalyzed hydroboration of acrylamides using Takacs chemistry, 38 or by Cu-catalyzed borylation using conditions developed by Yun.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	5	252	1858	1252	2081
20	20	The Hall group demonstrated that invertive coupling could even be achieved with an ester as the directing group, 37b but only in substrates such as 35 that are more reactive by virtue of having geminal boron substituents (Scheme 6, bottom).	Paper3_Perspective_2017	5	252	1988	1256	2238
21	21	Enantioenriched geminal diboron compound 35 was prepared by Cu-catalyzed borylation of the corresponding βborylated acrylate.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	5	252	2362	1250	2492
22	22	Instead, this group had to be converted into amide 37, which was then reactive in a second stereospecific (invertive) cross-coupling (Scheme 6) to afford 38.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	5	252	2729	1250	2860
23	23	This interesting effect may be related to the specific geometries required for the amide to activate the boron substituent, but certainly illustrates that there are many mechanistic details remaining to be elucidated about these types of cross-coupling reactions.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	5	1352	1113	2352	1381
24	24	In 2011, Suginome described the cross-coupling of cyclic boronamide 44, which proceeded in high yield with complete retention of stereochemistry (Scheme 8).	Paper3_Perspective_2017	5	1352	1434	2352	1564
25	25	In 2015, the Morken group showed definitively that hydroxyl groups act as internal activating groups for the cross-coupling of secondary C-B bonds.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	5	1353	2408	2356	2538
26	26	44 A variety of vicinally diborated compounds (47) were prepared by diboration of the corresponding olefins.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	5	1354	2492	2352	2630
27	27	Remarkably, substrates containing a free hydroxyl β to a Bpin substituent were shown to undergo selective cross-coupling at the less reactive secondary position (Scheme 9), demonstrating that the directing effect of a hydroxyl group is sufficient to overcome the inherent reactivity biases in terminal vicinal diboronates.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	5	1352	2591	2353	2850
28	28	Notably, if the hydroxyl is protected as a silyl ether, or if it is in the αor γ-position, cross-coupling occurs solely at the linear C-B bond.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	5	1353	2863	2352	2987
29	29	Despite this fact, complete selectivity for the β-boronic ester closer to the hydroxyl group was observed.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	6	254	1262	1252	1347
30	30	High-yielding cross-couplings of unactivated boranes have been reported by two groups.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	6	252	1858	1251	1943
31	31	Overall the transformation occurs with high yields and exceptional enantiospecificities.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	6	253	2271	1252	2400
32	32	The use of geminal diboron species such as 62 in stereoselective cross-couplings takes advantage of the increased reactivity described by Shibata 49 for geminally diborylated species compared to isolated organoboranes.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	6	1353	1796	2352	1973
33	33	The Hall group published a related stereoconvergent crosscoupling of geminal bis(boronic esters), which included ligand optimization, additive effects, scale up, and mechanistic studies implicating the hydrolysis of the boronate ester prior to reaction.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	7	253	379	1252	591
34	34	The use of 10 B-labeled enantiomerically enriched diboronate 67 revealed that the transmetalation occurred with inversion of stereochemistry (Scheme 11), as was observed with the phosphoramidate catalytic system mentioned above (Chart 6).	Paper3_Perspective_2017	7	252	2036	1252	2261
35	35	The development of single-electron transmetalation chemistry via photoredox/ nickel dual catalysis by the Molander group has offered a groundbreaking new approach to stereoconvergent crosscoupling of secondary alkylboron reagents.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	7	253	2500	1252	2722
36	36	The key step (Scheme 12) is the generation of an alkyl radical (75) by reaction of photoexcited Ir catalyst 74 with alkyltrifluoroborates (71) through a single electron transfer (SET) event in the photoredox catalytic cycle (depicted in green, Scheme 12).	Paper3_Perspective_2017	7	252	2683	1253	2906
37	37	In the presence of a nickel cross-coupling catalyst, the resulting radical is then trapped by nickel to generate an organometallic species.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	7	253	2869	1252	3042
38	38	Two possible mechanisms have been proposed for the crosscoupling process through DFT calculations: in the first (depicted in red, Scheme 12), addition of the newly generated radical 75 to nickel(0) complex 77 generates Ni(I)-alkyl species 78.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	7	1353	1721	2352	1897
39	39	Alternatively, oxidative addition of the aryl halides to nickel(0) may precede addition of the radical species to the resulting nickel(II) complex 80 (blue pathway).	Paper3_Perspective_2017	7	1353	1942	2356	2081
40	40	Single-electron reduction of 82 by the reduced photocatalyst 76 regenerates both the active nickel(0) catalyst 77 and the ground-state photocatalyst 73, completing the catalytic cycles.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	7	1352	2225	2352	2400
41	41	Thus, in the presence of a chiral ligand, the resulting diastereomeric nickel(III) complexes 79 undergo interconversion via homolysis and recombination of the nickel-Csp 3 bond prior to stereoretentive reductive elimination.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	7	1353	2492	2351	2712
42	42	In The first example of cross-coupling of secondary alkyl βtrifluoroboratoketones (89) and -esters with aryl bromides was reported using Ni/photoredox dual catalysis.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	8	253	1446	1250	1576
43	43	Chemoselectivity in Suzuki-Miyaura cross-couplings can refer to substrates containing multiple electrophiles or multiple nucleophiles.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	8	254	2454	1251	2585
44	44	In general, the chemoselective reaction of one boron substituent in the presence of another is controlled by two methods: the use of protecting groups on boron to prevent transmetalation, or the design of conditions that promote transmetalation of one C-B bond in the presence of another.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	8	253	2729	1252	2950
45	45	Aryl-Bdan esters were shown to be inert to transmetalation relative to aryl boronic acids 58a and pinacol esters.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	8	1353	1492	2351	1621
46	46	Thus, molecules could be designed containing both an electrophile and nucleophile and prevented from reacting with each other by virtue of a protecting group on boron.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	8	1352	1583	2353	1760
47	47	Diborylated alkene 94, in which one boron is protected by a dan group and the other as a pinacol ester, 60 was shown to undergo completely selective coupling at the internal Bpin group rather than the terminal Bdan.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	8	1352	1900	2352	2081
48	48	Burke's approach to boron protecting groups employed a multidentate ligand derived from N-methylimidodiacetic acid (MIDA) 58b to inhibit coupling by donation of the nitrogen lone pair to the empty p-orbital on boron (97), resulting in rehybridization from sp 2 to sp 3 .	Paper3_Perspective_2017	8	1352	2179	2352	2446
49	49	BMIDA groups are unreactive toward transmetalation and can therefore be carried through cross-couplings as handles for further functionalization after basic hydrolysis to restore the parent boronic acid.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	8	1352	2410	2352	2584
50	50	The Burke group demonstrated that iterative Suzuki-Miyaura cross-couplings using MIDA-protected halogenated boronic acid building blocks can be readily accomplished. 58b After coupling at the halide of 97 with a reactive organoborane (Scheme 15), hydrolysis of 98 using aqueous base reveals the parent boronic acid 99, which can be used for subsequent crosscoupling reactions.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	8	1351	2591	2352	2906
51	51	62 First, a pinacol boron group was installed by coppercatalyzed enantioselective allylic substitution of allylic phosphate 100 and bis(pinacolatoboryl)methane.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	9	1352	1518	2350	1896
52	52	The resulting homoallyl boronic ester 101 was then subjected to hydroboration with 9-BBN, affording diboron product 102.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	9	1352	1858	2352	1989
53	53	In the presence of a vinyl iodide using Pd(dppf)Cl 2 as a catalyst, crosscoupling occurred selectively at the trialkylborane in the presence of the less Lewis-acidic BPin substituent.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	9	1352	1950	2351	2125
54	54	Selectivity is then achieved due to faster transmetalation of the former through kinetic discrimination by the palladium(II) pre-transmetalation intermediate.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	9	1353	2546	2353	2675
55	55	In coupling reactions employing completely identical substituents on boron, Morken 66 and Fernandez 67 were pioneers, employing the low reactivity of chiral secondary C-B bonds to enable sequential reaction of two C-B bonds in vicinal diboron species.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	10	252	1396	1252	1657
56	56	In 2004, the Morken group 66 demonstrated that vicinal 1,2diboronates (113) derived from the enantioselective diboration of terminal aliphatic olefins undergo selective cross-coupling at the linear aliphatic C-B bond (Scheme 19A).	Paper3_Perspective_2017	10	253	1616	1252	1805
57	57	In both approaches, the initial selective cross-coupling was made possible by significant differences in reactivity between primary and secondary C-B bonds.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	10	252	2546	1251	2675
58	58	Because of the lack of efficient methods at the time for cross-coupling of secondary C-B bonds, other reactions (oxidation, amination, homologation) were employed to transform this species.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	10	253	2637	1256	2813
59	59	As previously noted (Chart 2, eq 1), our group observed dramatic differences in reactivity between chiral secondary benzylic C-B bonds (which were reactive) and linear achiral C-B bonds (which were not), during our initial study of the cross-coupling of secondary benzylic organoboranes.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	10	252	2955	1253	3181
60	60	These compounds are readily prepared by the high-yielding and enantioselective diboration of styrene derivatives.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	10	1352	2042	2351	2162
61	61	As expected, the aryl Csp 2 -B bond undergoes preferential transmetalation and cross-coupling.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	10	1354	3004	2352	3135
62	62	Electronwithdrawing substituents (i.e., 4-phenacyl) led to significantly higher losses of enantiomeric purity than electron rich systems.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	11	252	3047	1253	3181
63	63	As a more dramatic illustration of the use of multiply borylated compounds in iterative coupling, we examined the reactivity of trisborylated compound 124 containing an aryl B-Csp 2 bond, a primary B-Csp 3 bond, and a secondary benzylic B-Csp 3 bond.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	11	1332	2812	2353	3038
64	64	Subsequent coupling of the primary position was accomplished in the same reaction flask using RuPhos as a ligand along with higher Journal of the American Chemical Society proportions of water, utilizing the same organic solvent, temperature, and inorganic base.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	11	1353	3047	2352	3276
65	65	Another orthogonal cross-coupling in which two boron substituents are sequentially cross-coupled without the use of protecting groups has been described by the Molander group.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	12	252	975	1256	1106
66	66	In this case, single electron-type transmetalation takes place through the use of photoredox/nickel dual catalysis (see Scheme 13) and selectively activates sp 3 -hybridized trifluoroborate salts (127) in the presence of sp 2 -hybridized boron reagents (126, Scheme 21).	Paper3_Perspective_2017	12	253	1112	1251	1335
67	67	Reaction of benzyl trifluoroborate salt 127 and brominated aryl boronic ester 126 under dual-catalytic cross-coupling conditions resulted in selective activation of the sp 3 -hybridized boronate, affording borylated diarylmethane 128.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	12	253	2173	1251	2394
68	68	It was further demonstrated that the aryl boronic ester moiety in 128 could undergo subsequent functionalization through Pd-catalyzed Suzuki coupling (129), oxidation, or Rhcatalyzed conjugate addition.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	12	253	2494	1252	2670
69	69	The stereochemical outcome of these reactions is highly dependent on the nature of the substrate, as well as the choice of additive and reaction conditions.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	12	1354	748	2353	869
70	70	The de Meijere group reported that a (1-cyclopropylcyclopropyl)boronate underwent cross-coupling with a variety of aryl bromides and iodides in modest yield with no observable rearrangement of products, 76 while Wang and Kiefer demonstrated the alkylation of aryl iodides using tert-butyl-9-BBN.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	12	1353	2310	2353	2536
71	71	The seminal work of Aggarwal on the cross-coupling of tertiary propargylic boronic esters (Scheme 5) remains the sole example of stereospecific cross-coupling of a tertiary boron compound.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	12	1353	2773	2352	2949
72	72	The development of such a method of carbon-carbon bond formation between an unactivated, enantioenriched sp 3 boron reagent and an sp 3 electrophile would afford unprecedented synthetic utility.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	13	252	516	1256	780
73	0	To this reaction mixture, above prepared acid chloride (compound 2a) was slowly added and stirred the reaction mixture at RT for 2h.	Paper2_SI	4	303	1188	2179	1319
74	1	To a stirred solution of crude compound 4a in DCM (60 mL) was added n-propyl amine (1.50 mL) dropwise at 0 o C and the resulting reaction mixture was stirred at RT for 1h.	Paper2_SI	4	301	1878	2179	2009
75	2	To a stirred solution of compound 5a (0.50 g, 2.89 mmol) in DCM (10 mL) were added Et3N (0.45 mL, 3.17 mmol) and N-Bromosuccinimide (0.50 g, 2.89 mmol) under N2 atm at 0 o C and the reaction mixture was stirred at RT for 1h.	Paper2_SI	5	301	307	2181	519
76	3	To a stirred solution of compound 6a (0.50 g, 1.98 mmol) in anhydrous THF (12 mL), compound 7a (0.72 g, 5.95 mmol), K2CO3 (1.63 g, 11.88 mmol) were added at RT and degassed the reaction mixture by using argon for 5 min.	Paper2_SI	5	301	1851	2180	2069
77	4	To a stirred solution of compound 8a (1.2 g, 4.81 mmol) in DCM (10 mL) under N2 atm were added Et3N (0.67 mL, 4.81 mmol) and N-Bromosuccinimide (1.28 g, 7.21 mmol) at 0 o C and stirred the reaction mixture at RT for 4h.	Paper2_SI	6	301	702	2180	1051
78	5	To a stirred solution of compound 12 (0.30 g, 0.83 mmol), Bis(pinacolato)diboron (0.42 g, 1.67 mmol) and KOAc (0.24 g, 2.51 mmol) in Dioxane: DMSO (10 mL & 1 mL) under N2 atm was added PdCl2dppf (0.07g, 0.08 mmol) at RT and the reaction mixture was stirred at 95 o C for 16h.	Paper2_SI	6	301	2252	2181	2703
79	6	To a stirred solution of compound 3a (1.36 g, 19.20mmol) in DCM (15 mL) under N2 atm were added DMAP (0.26 g, 2.13 mmol), Et3N (4.0 mL, 29.02 mmol) and cooled the reaction mixture to 0 o C.	Paper2_SI	7	301	2947	2180	3292
80	7	To a stirred solution of compound 3b (4.0 g, 27.21 mmol) in DCM (40 mL) under N2 atm, Et3N (4.0 mL, 27.21 mmol) and N-Iodosuccinimide (6.10 g, 27.21 mmol) at 0 o C were added and the reaction mixture was stirred at RT for 1h.	Paper2_SI	8	301	2051	2180	2350
81	0	Alternatively, nucleophilic substitution of chromene acetals, prepared by reduction of readily available coumarins, potentially offers a versatile solution to the synthesis of this scaffold where the C-2 group is introduced in the final step.	Paper5_Nickel_2012	1	1316	2167	2311	2355
82	1	This organocatalytic Petasis-like reaction uses functional group tolerant boronate esters but is only effective for intrinsically nucleophilic partners such as cinnamyl and π-rich arenes.	Paper5_Nickel_2012	2	221	231	1216	412
83	2	Herein, we report such a method: a nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction of aryl-and heteroarylboronic acids with chromene acetals.	Paper5_Nickel_2012	2	221	1234	1215	1364
84	3	Although recent reports have described SuzukiÀ Miyaura reactions with allylic phenoxides, acetates, and carbonates, 15 the use of allylic acetals in cross-coupling has been limited to Kumada 16 and Negishi 17 reactions.	Paper5_Nickel_2012	2	221	1682	1215	1912
85	4	Slow oxidative addition of electron-rich C sp 3ÀO bonds to a transition metal 18 and the preponderance of such bonds in the substrate as well as the product of acetal crosscoupling are two likely causes for this comparative lack of success.	Paper5_Nickel_2012	2	221	1831	1219	2119
86	5	In an initial demonstration of this hypothesis, we chose to evaluate chromene-based acetals for the preparation of 2-substituted 2H-chromenes (Scheme 1).	Paper5_Nickel_2012	2	1317	1801	2315	1938
87	6	Subjecting 2-ethoxy-2H-chromene 1a to 10 mol % Ni(cod) 2 , 10 mol % PPh 3 , and 2 equiv of p-fluorophenyl boronic acid at rt in dioxane/t-AmOH as solvent afforded the desired crosscoupled heterocycle 3 in 92% yield (Figure 2 ).	Paper5_Nickel_2012	2	1317	1900	2312	2180
88	7	In fact, competition studies indicate that electron-deficient aryl boronic acids display higher reactivity than electron-rich ones (4-CF 3 > 4-H > 4-MeO).	Paper5_Nickel_2012	3	221	2411	1215	2600
89	8	Dibenzofuran (19), dibenzothiophene (20), and indole (25) boronic acids smoothly underwent coupling (Figure 2 ).	Paper5_Nickel_2012	3	1317	2163	2312	2303
90	9	Given our success with electron-deficient aryl boronic acids, we assumed that catalyst deactivation by the basic nitrogen, rather than the electron-deficient nature of the heterocycle, was responsible for its relative lack of reactivity.	Paper5_Nickel_2012	3	1317	2375	2310	2606
91	10	The success of these substrates appears to be the result of steric shielding, as both trifluoromethyl (28) and methoxy (26)substituted pyridyl boronic acids undergo coupling with similar efficiency.	Paper5_Nickel_2012	3	1318	2668	2312	2859
92	11	Utilizing Molander's recently disclosed method for the direct synthesis of aryl boronic acids from aryl chlorides, 26 we were able to successfully isolate the requisite boronic acids.	Paper5_Nickel_2012	4	221	2270	1216	2458
93	12	In conclusion, we have reported a modular synthesis of 2-aryl and 2-heteroaryl 2H-chromene derivatives from readily available chromene acetals that is characterized by a broad scope, mild conditions, and an inexpensive metal/ligand system.	Paper5_Nickel_2012	4	1316	1391	2315	1629

102	2	We ®nd that upon increasing the conjugation length of the B moiety, from a thiophene unit to 2,5-bis(2 H -vinyl thienyl)thiophene, the ¯uorescence quantum yields are reduced both in solution (from 51 to 11%) and in solid state.	Paper1_Thiophene_2002	1	178	1306	2269	1385
103	3	When the B unit is changed from thiophene to thiophene-S,S-dioxide, there is a signi®cant increase in both the ionisation potential and electron af®nity, and a concurrent reduction of the solution ¯uorescence ef®ciency (down to 16%).	Paper1_Thiophene_2002	1	178	1398	2269	1522

Though most widely utilized for the synthesis of sp’—sp” linkages, the use of this reaction to form stereochemistry-bearing sp’— sp* bonds has received widespread attention over the past decade. This Perspective highlights approaches to the synthesis of enantioenriched molecules via the Suzuki— Miyaura reaction. Particular focus is placed on the use of enantiomerically enriched organoboron compounds as coupling partners in stereospecific processes, as well as the development of enantioconvergent and group-selective reactions. In addition, progress in the development of chemoselective, iterative cross-coupling methods will be discussed. MH INTRODUCTION The Suzuki—Miyaura cross-coupling’ is the number one method for forming carbon—carbon bonds in the pharmaceut- ical industry,” and is frequently utilized in the construction of organic materials. In fact, the Suzuki—Miyaura reaction is so frequently employed that many consider it responsible for overpopulating the libraries of pharmaceutical compounds with flat, sp? carbon-rich molecules.’ Such molecules have suboptimal pharmacokinetic properties and appear to be more likely to cause off-target activity, possibly due to their flat structures and resulting target promiscuity.”* © 2017 American Chemical Society a& ae w ACS Publications boron-based nucleophiles in stereoconvergent processes, the : a: 8 reader is referred to other work in this area. M@ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION a-Directed Couplings. Inspired by the facile synthesis of chiral boronic esters derived from hydroboration chemistry,’ our group set out to examine the applicability of these species in cross-coupling chemistry. At the time, the only precedent for enantiospecific Suzuki—Miyaura cross-coupling was found in cyclopropylated substrates.'”'' This work added to existing literature documenting the feasibility of Suzuki—Miyaura cross- couplings employing cyclopropyl organoboron species.'°*!”'? Cyclopropyl substituents are specialized because of the unique hybridization at carbon in the cyclopropyl unit and because geometrical requirements suppress /-hydride elimination. Therefore, extrapolation to simple aliphatic boranes was nontrivial. Chart 1.

The higher stability of the intermediate organolithium compound afforded by its benzylic nature results in an increased reversibility in the boronic ester trapping reaction. This problem was solved through the use of smaller substituents on boron. This resulted in a faster rate of trapping of the configurationally labile organolithium species (which was formed under thermody- namic control) as well as reduced reversibility in boronate formation resulting in a change from virtually racemic to 96% e.e.

223	-1	In this section, all of the examples presented benefited from some type of a-system adjacent to the B—C bond in question. Thus, couplings of benzylic, allylic, propargylic, and doubly benzylic organoboron species have been described. Although the presence of the adjacent z-system undoubtedly accelerates the reaction by weakening of the B—C bond, this is not the only effect; otherwise coupling of, for example, organoborane 6 would occur under traditional conditions and not require the presence of silver oxide to promote transmetalation. Similarly, the silver oxide effect seems confined to or enhanced by boranes bearing a a-system. Considering these two facts, the effect of silver may be to facilitate transmetalation by initial complexation to the 7—systems present in the substrate classes described herein (Chart 5). The reactivity of 29b under non- silver oxide-promoted conditions stands in contrast to this, but may be explained by an overall higher reactivity of these doubly benzylic systems. Pd--Y L,Ar? To explain the observed inversion, an S,2-like transition state in which the amide coordinates to the departing “BPin” unit was invoked (Scheme 5, bottom left).

225	-1	In 2010, the Molander group employed chiral boronic esters such as 33 in cross-coupling reactions to give arylated derivatives in high yields, with high enantiospecificity, again arising from inversion of configuration (Scheme 6, top).°” The The Hall group demonstrated that invertive coupling could even be achieved with an ester as the directing group,” but only in substrates such as 35 that are more reactive by virtue of having geminal boron substituents (Scheme 6, bottom). Shibata,” Morken,*' and others have shown that the presence of one boron substituent in close proximity (geminal or vicinal) to another enables more facile C—B bond activation. In addition to carbonyl-type activating groups, Suginome*’ and Morken** have shown that appropriately positioned hydroxyl groups can be powerful directing groups to activate the cross-coupling of otherwise unreactive chiral C—B bonds. In 2011, Suginome described the cross-coupling of cyclic boronamide 44, which proceeded in high yield with complete retention of stereochemistry (Scheme 8).*° Since the nascent In 2015, the Morken group showed definitively that hydroxyl groups act as internal activating groups for the cross-coupling of secondary C—B bonds.** A variety of vicinally diborated compounds (47) were prepared by diboration of the corresponding olefins. Remarkably, substrates containing a free hydroxyl # to a Bpin substituent were shown to undergo selective cross-coupling at the less reactive secondary position (Scheme 9), demonstrating that the directing effect of a hydroxyl group is sufficient to overcome the inherent reactivity biases in terminal vicinal diboronates.**	Paper3_Perspective_2017	5	252	700	2356	2850

Conversion of the Bdan group to a BF; substituent after the first coupling was not sufficient to permit coupling with the weakly directing ester group.

The development of single-electron transmetalation chemistry via photoredox/ nickel dual catalysis by the Molander group has offered a groundbreaking new approach to stereoconvergent cross- coupling of secondary alkylboron reagents.” The key step (Scheme 12) is the generation of an alkyl radical (75) by reaction of photoexcited Ir catalyst 74 with alkyltrifluoroborates (71) through a single electron transfer (SET) event in the photoredox catalytic cycle (depicted in green, Scheme 12). In the presence of a nickel cross-coupling catalyst, the resulting radical is then trapped by nickel to generate an organometallic species. Unlike classical two-electron transmetalation processes, which are redox neutral, this process results in a one electron oxidation at the metal center. If the radical generated is prochiral, a stereocenter is generated upon trapping. Ol. LM"" MP""Ln Reduction i RVR? RIOR? FP iN po RI R? Computational studies have suggested that the barrier to reductive elimination from 79 is larger than that of the radical dissociation process.°* Thus, in the presence of a chiral ligand, the resulting diastereomeric nickel(III) complexes 79 undergo interconversion via homolysis and recombination of the nickel—Csp* bond prior to stereoretentive reductive elimi- nation. Due to the difference in rate of reductive elimination between the two diastereomeric complexes, net enrichment of one stereoisomer in the resulting cross-coupled product is observed, rendering the reaction stereoconvergent. Although enantioselectivities remain modest at present (Scheme 13), the development of a novel stereoconvergent manifold for cross- coupling of alkylboranes provides a wealth of new opportunity in this area."

233	-1	In general, the chemoselective reaction of one boron substituent in the presence of another is controlled by two methods: the use of protecting groups on boron to prevent transmetalation, or the design of conditions that promote transmetalation of one C—B bond in the presence of another. Burke’s approach to boron protecting groups employed a multidentate ligand derived from N-methylimidodiacetic acid (MIDA)°**? to inhibit coupling by donation of the nitrogen lone pair to the empty p-orbital on boron (97), resulting in rehybridization from sp” to sp*. BMIDA groups are unreactive toward transmetalation and can therefore be carried through cross-couplings as handles for further functionalization after basic hydrolysis to restore the parent boronic acid.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	8	253	2225	2352	2950
234	-1	In 2007, the Suginome and Burke groups independently reported the development of protecting groups for boron.”* The Suginome approach involved the use of the 1,8- diaminonaphthalene (dan) group (Scheme 14),°°* which blocks the ability of boron to participate in cross-couplings due to The Burke group demonstrated that iterative Suzuki- Miyaura cross-couplings using MIDA-protected halogenated boronic acid building blocks can be readily accomplished.°*” After coupling at the halide of 97 with a reactive organoborane (Scheme 15), hydrolysis of 98 using aqueous base reveals the parent boronic acid 99, which can be used for subsequent cross- coupling reactions. This control of reactivity enables multiple iterative cross-couplings (Scheme 15). The widening scope of organoboron species that can be employed in cross-coupling chemistry (aryl, alkenyl, alkyl, and chiral aliphatic) then provides the exciting possibility to employ the Suzuki—Miyaura cross-coupling in the automated preparation of many types of organic molecules.

LN No coH __ NaOH (aq) “Shown in the bottom section are two examples of compounds prepared using automated synthesis.° deprotection of the BMIDA group, cross-coupling, and purification. MIDA boronates were shown to possess an extremely high affinity for silica in MeOH/Et,O mixtures, allowing for the facile removal of byproducts and excess reagents. Conversely, boronates were rapidly eluted upon washing with THF, enabling a straightforward purification sequence. The deprotection—coupling—purification procedure was fully automated, culminating in the development of “small- molecule synthesizer” capable of cleanly synthesizing a diverse library of small molecules using a single general, automated platform, including a range of macrocyclic and polycyclic natural products. Although functional group manipulations must still be carried out off line, the concept of automating the synthesis of small molecules is potentially transformational.” This brings us to the second approach to control selectivity and reactivity in Suzuki—Miyaura cross-coupling reactions. In addition to the powerful use of protecting groups, several groups have harnessed the inherent reactivity differences of closely related C—B bonds to affect iterative cross-coupling reactions. In this case, the substituents on boron are either identical or closely related. Although out of order chronolog- ically, we will begin with closely related but distinct boron substituents, since this is more closely related to the protecting group approach. For this strategy to be successful, there must be inherent differences in selectivity imparted by the ancillary substituents, and interchange of the substituents on boron must be slower than cross-coupling.

The resulting homoallyl boronic ester 101 was then subjected to hydro- boration with 9-BBN, affording diboron product 102. In the presence of a vinyl iodide using Pd(dppf)Cl, as a catalyst, cross- coupling occurred selectively at the trialkylborane in the presence of the less Lewis-acidic BPin substituent. Cross-coupling of the second boron substituent was induced by revealing an adjacent alcohol, which was found to promote copper-catalyzed allylation to generate 104.° The alcohol functionality was critical in promoting this reaction, as only trace product was observed with the corresponding silyl ether. The ability to differentiate these two C—B bonds is also likely a function of relative reactivity in the transmetalation event. The Watson group employed a similar strategy,°* but in their case, the two boron species were a pinacol boronic ester and a free boronic acid. Selectivity is then achieved due to faster transmetalation of the former through kinetic discrimination by the palladium(II) pre-transmetalation intermediate. In this case, careful control over reaction conditions was necessary to prevent pinacol equilibration. Chemoselectivity was demon- strated by reaction between two separate molecules rather than one molecule with two different types of boranes (Scheme 18). As expected, the amount of water was found to have a substantial impact on the selectivity of the reaction as excess water promotes scrambling of the pinacol group and equilibration between the two boron species.** Sequestration of the boronic acid in the bulk aqueous phase as the conjugate boronate under alkaline aqueous conditions was also found to contribute to decreases in selectivity.

Building this observation into an iterative coupling approach, we began by examining vicinal diboronates 118, which contain both a linear and secondary benzylic pinacol boronic ester. These compounds are readily prepared by the high-yielding and enantioselective diboration of styrene derivatives.” The use of Pd(OAc), and dicyclohexylbiaryl phosphines RuPhos or SPhos with simple inorganic bases was found to promote selective transmetalation of the linear C—B bond (119), without any reaction at the secondary C—B bond (Scheme 20).”° Substrates that were prone to deboronation benefitted from the use of higher proportions of water in mixed organic/aqueous solvent systems, which may be due to a decrease i in the effective pH of the organic phase as more water is added.”° DOI: 10.1021/jacs.7b08326 J.

238	-1	In coupling reactions employing completely identical substituents on boron, Morken® and Fernandez®’ were pioneers, employing the low reactivity of chiral secondary C— B bonds to enable sequential reaction of two C—B bonds in vicinal diboron species. Subsequent silver oxide-promoted Pd-catalyzed cross-cou- pling of the benzylic C—B bond afforded a variety of 1,1,2- triarylethanes (120) in good to moderate yields with a good tolerance of electronic variation in substrate.”° Stereoretention for these cross-couplings was generally around 90%, slightly lower than observed in the couplings of simpler 1-phenylethyl boronic esters, but still acceptable. No regioisomeric products resulting from f-hydride elimination were observed.”°	Paper3_Perspective_2017	10	252	1396	2353	2906
239	-1	In 2004, the Morken group” ° demonstrated that vicinal 1,2- diboronates (113) derived from the enantioselective diboration of terminal aliphatic olefins undergo selective cross-coupling at the linear aliphatic C—B bond (Scheme 19A). The secondary C-B bond, which is unaffected by the cross-coupling reaction despite the absence of a protecting group, is then available for subsequent transformations. The use of microwave irradiation was found to accelerate the reaction while still leaving the secondary C—B bond untouched. Since methods had not been reported to enable coupling of the secondary chiral C—B bond at the time, it was transformed through oxidation to the corresponding alcohol (114) or Matteson-style homologa- tion.” In later work, Morken clearly demonstrated that although coupling only occurs at the linear boronic ester substituent, the presence of the internal secondary boronic ester is critical in order to observe coupling.” To test the generality of the concept of selective trans- metalation, we employed substrates 121 containing an aryl Csp?—B bond and a secondary Csp?—B bond. As expected, the aryl Csp’—B bond undergoes preferential transmetalation and cross-coupling.

Electron- withdrawing substituents (ie., 4-phenacyl) led to significantly higher losses of enantiomeric purity than electron rich As a more dramatic illustration of the use of multiply borylated compounds in iterative coupling, we examined the reactivity of trisborylated compound 124 containing an aryl B— Csp” bond, a primary B—Csp* bond, and a secondary benzylic B—Csp*® bond.

While differentiating between an aryl C—B bond and a chiral benzylic C—B bond may be unsurprising due to the substantial differences in reactivity between the two, the selective reaction of an aryl C—B bond in the presence of a reactive primary B—Csp* bond is quite remarkable. Furthermore, the similarity of the conditions employed demonstrates the significant effect of carbon hybridization on C—B transmetalation rates. Ph~ ~BF3K 127 Ir photocatalyst Scheme 21.

Reaction of benzyl trifluoroborate salt 127 and brominated aryl boronic ester 126 under dual-catalytic cross-coupling conditions resulted in selective activation of the sp*-hybridized boronate, affording borylated diarylmethane 128. The pendant boronic ester functionality was preserved in this reaction, and no evidence of biaryl formation or oligomerization through sp’—sp* cross-coupling was noted. H@ OUTLOOK The field of stereospecific and stereoselective Suzuki—Miyaura cross-coupling has witnessed considerable advances in the past decade. However, several important problems remain unsolved. As described in this Perspective, secondary alkylboron reagents typically require activation from an adjacent functional group, such as a a-system or a Lewis-basic heteroatom or carbonyl group in order to participate in high-yielding stereospecific cross-coupling reactions. In this regard, the 2014 report from the Biscoe group on the use of unactivated secondary alkylboron reagents represents a significant development in the field.*” Further examples in which similarly unsubstituted organoboron species are engaged in cross-coupling will be essential for the stereocontrolled introduction of increasingly diverse molecular frameworks employing cross-coupling chemistry.

242	-1	After filtration through a silica gel plug, the resulting benzylic boronic esters could be subjected to silver oxide-promoted cross-coupling conditions to generate the triarylated product 125 in moderate yield over the three-step sequence. A single regioisomer was prepared, demonstrating the highly chemo- selective nature of the reaction sequence. ° It was further demonstrated that the aryl boronic ester moiety in 128 could undergo subsequent functionalization through Pd-catalyzed Suzuki coupling (129), oxidation, or Rh- catalyzed conjugate addition. Notably, MIDA boronates were also tolerated as inert sp’-hybridized boron reagents in this reaction, suggesting that this methodology may have further applications in the automated iterative synthesis previously reported by Burke.” The stereochemical outcome of these reactions is highly dependent on the nature of the substrate, as well as the choice of additive and reaction conditions. Efforts to further understand the underlying mechanistic features responsible for the stereochemical outcome represent a fertile area for future research. Elucidating the role of crucial additives, as well as understanding the prerequisites for reactivity of a given boron reagent is an important step in the development of new methodologies for stereoselective synthesis. In recent years, the Denmark group has reported remarkable advances on the detection and characterization of pre-transmetalation inter- mediates in Suzuki—Miyaura reactions, ’* and a combined study by Lloyd-Jones and Burke”® provided much needed insight into the mechanism of action of MIDA boronates. Further study on the underlying mechanism of transmetalation will likely offer new insights into reaction design.	Paper3_Perspective_2017	12	252	696	2353	2852
243	-1	Another orthogonal cross-coupling in which two boron substituents are sequentially cross-coupled without the use of protecting groups has been described by the Molander group.’° In this case, single electron-type transmetalation takes place through the use of photoredox/nickel dual catalysis (see Scheme 13) and selectively activates sp°-hybridized trifluor- oborate salts (127) in the presence of sp’-hybridized boron reagents (126, Scheme 21). > The former are more reactive Though still being developed, single-electron transmetalation has emerged as a remarkable advance in the development of cross-coupling methodology of sp* hybridized organometallic compounds.’° A complete re-imagining of the mechanism of transmetalation permitted the development of this powerful coupling method, which has been shown to both outperform traditional two-electron chemistry in some cases as well as offer unique orthogonal reactivity. The continued development of stereoconvergent methods represents an important advance in asymmetric catalysis and should constitute a thriving area of research for years to come.

244	-1	The generation of enantioenriched quaternary carbon centers via cross-coupling reactions represents an important challenge that is still in its infancy. To this end, the use of tertiary boronic esters as competent cross-coupling partners in Suzuki—Miyaura reactions remains an unsolved problem of great interest. Two independent reports emerged in 2010 describing the limited cross-coupling activity of tertiary organoboron compounds. The de Meijere group reported that a (1-cyclopropyl- cyclopropyl)boronate underwent cross-coupling with a variety of aryl bromides and iodides in modest yield with no observable rearrangement of products,’° while Wang and Kiefer demonstrated the alkylation of aryl iodides using tert-butyl-9- BBN.” The Molander group recently described a landmark report on the construction of achiral quaternary carbon centers through photoredox/nickel dual catalysis of tertiary organo- trifluoroborate reagents, the most detailed description of tertiary boron nucleophiles in Suzuki—Miyaura cross-coupling to date.’® The seminal work of Aggarwal on the cross-coupling of tertiary propargylic boronic esters (Scheme 5) remains the sole example of stereospecific cross-coupling of a tertiary boron compound.”°	Paper3_Perspective_2017	12	1352	1991	2356	2949

Oo OEt (HO)2B —> 26-97% Ni(0) 36 examples A modular and highly efficient protocol for the synthesis of 2-aryl- and heteroaryl-2H-chromenes is described. Under base-free conditions, readily accessible 2-ethoxy-2H-chromenes undergo C,,:—0 activation and C,,:—C bond formation in the presence of an inexpensive nickel catalyst and boronic acids. This new strategy enables broad access to 2-substituted-2H-chromenes and has been applied to the late-stage incorporation of complex molecules, including the pharmaceuticals loratidine and indomethacin methyl ester. 2-Substituted 2H-chromenes and their analogs are per- vasive molecular structures in chemistry, biology, and medicine. Examples include fungicidal agents,' potent antioxidants (e.g., Vitamin E),” and pharmaceuticals that possess antitumor,* antibacterial,’ and antiviral activity.° The heterocycle is also used extensively as a photochromic material® and a precursor to flavylium dyes’ (Figure 1). Accordingly, the availability of efficient and modular (1) Lago, J. H. G.; Ramos, C. S.; Casanova, D. C. C.; Morandim, A. D.; Bergamo, D. C. B.; Cavalheiro, A. J.; Bolzani, V.

Numerous synthetic approaches have been devised to access 2-substituted 2H-chromenes (Scheme 1).” Routinely employed protocols rely on benzopyran construction from phenol or salicylaldehyde derivatives by oxa—Michael-type or olefin metathesis annulations.'° These approaches typically involve multistep sequences, incorporate the C-2 group early in the synthesis, or lack broad generality. Alternatively, nucleophilic substitution of chromene ace- tals, prepared by reduction of readily available coumarins, potentially offers a versatile solution to the synthesis of this scaffold where the C-2 group is introduced in the final step. Reactions with Grignard reagents are frequently used; while these obviate the need for prefunctionalized frag- ment synthesis,'' they often produce regioisomeric pro- duct mixtures and are intolerant of many functional groups.'? Schaus recently reported a related approach that (10) For examples in the context of target synthesis, see ref 3 and: (a) Brimble, M.; Jay-Smith, M.; Furkert, D.; Sperry, J.

For these reasons, a concise, efficient, and general method for the synthesis of chromenes is still in demand.

Pharmacologically active and photochromic chro- mene derivatives. Herein, we report such a method: a nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction of aryl- and heteroarylboronic acids with chromene acetals. The method represents a mechanistic alternative to nucleophilic acetal substitution that enables access to a broad range of previously inacces- sible C-2 substituted chromenes by late-stage diversifica- tion of a common scaffold. To our knowledge, it also represents the first example of a Suzuki—Miyaura cross- coupling reaction with allylic acetals. (13) Moquist, P. N.; Kodama, T.; Schaus, S. E. Angew. Chem., Int.

Inspired by these findings, we decided to pursue the possibility that boronic acid activation* of an allylic acetal in the absence of a base would encourage selective oxidative addition and trans- metalation. A particularly attractive aspect of this ap- proach is that it would afford a neutral method for the synthesis of allylic ethers from widely available and stable precursors.”* Scheme 1.

Subjecting 2-ethoxy-2H-chromene 1a to 10 mol % Ni(cod)s, 10 mol % PPh3, and 2 equiv of p-fluorophenyl boronic acid at rt in dioxane/t-AmOH as solvent afforded the desired cross- coupled heterocycle 3 in 92% yield (Figure 2). In the absence of the Ni catalyst, 3 was not observed, even when the reaction was conducted at elevated temperatures (<5% yield). Furthermore, it was found that the type of organoboron nucleophile employed significantly affected the reaction outcome. The use of boronate esters or potassium aryltrifluoroborate salts also did not afford the desired product. Since these boronates are less Lewis acidic than boronic acids the results provide circumstantial support for the role of the boronic acid in activating the acetal toward oxidative addition. Notably, the chromene acetals possess two distinct ethereal leaving groups, but selective activation of the more Lewis basic exocyclic ether is observed. The reaction is also regioselective, delivering (21) Nielsen, D. K.; Doyle, A. G. Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2011, 50, 6056-6059. 1617	Paper5_Nickel_2012	2	221	174	2315	3179

Overall, the method displays an expansive scope with respect to both coupling partners, is scalable, and requires short reaction times (vida infra). Moreover, the catalyst and ligand are both inexpensive and purification of the products is straightforward because the only side products arise from acetal hydrolysis and protodeboronation.~* (24) Determined by LC/MS.

See Sup- porting Information for details. 1618 the outlined conditions (Figure 2, 18, 95% yield) more sterically encumbered boronic acids were generally not reactive. This limitation was overcome by employing a higher reaction temperature (100 °C); at this temperature, a PPh;/Ni ratio of 3:1 was necessary to prevent the formation of nickel black. Under these modified condi- tions sterically encumbered (e.g., 2,6-(CH3)2 21, 2-Ph 22) and strongly deactivated (e.g., 2,4-(CF3)2 23) aryl boronic acids reacted smoothly. Org.

263	-1	The reaction proved general for a broad range of aryl boronic acids, with yields ranging from 51 to 97% (Figure 2). High efficiency was observed regardless of the electronic nature of the para- or meta-substituted aryl boronic acid employed (e.g., a-neutral boronic acids 2—7, 16, 17 and z-deficient boronic acids 8—15). In this regard, the strategy holds a distinct advantage over Petasis- type reactions as its success is not governed by the intrinsic reactivity of the nucleophile. In fact, competition studies indicate that electron-deficient aryl boronic acids display higher reactivity than electron-rich ones (4-CF3 > 4-H > 4-MeO).”° Notably, the reaction proceeded with similar effi- ciency and high regioselectivity (8:1 rr) on a gram scale using a reduced catalyst loading and an elevated concentration, indicating that it should be a viable approach for the prepa- rative scale synthesis of chromene derivatives (Figure 2, 2). Given the importance of heterocyclic motifs within biologically relevant molecules, our attention turned to heteroarylboronic acids as reaction partners. Dibenzofu- ran (19), dibenzothiophene (20), and indole (25) boronic acids smoothly underwent coupling (Figure 2). However, 3-pyridylboronic acid failed to deliver product. Given our success with electron-deficient aryl boronic acids, we as- sumed that catalyst deactivation by the basic nitrogen, rather than the electron-deficient nature of the heterocycle, was responsible for its relative lack of reactivity. Pleasingly, we found that substituted pyridyl boronic acids (Figure 2, 26—28) were compatible with the reaction conditions. The success of these substrates appears to be the result of steric shielding, as both trifluoromethyl (28) and methoxy (26)- substituted pyridyl boronic acids undergo coupling with similar efficiency. However, the use of related heteroaryl boronic acids bearing exposed Lewis basic nitrogens (quinoline, pyrimidine, isoxazole, imidazole) remains an important limitation of the methodology.

While ortho-tolyl boronic acid could be used at 40 °C under The scope of the chromene acetal component in this cross-coupling protocol has also been studied (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Scope of 2-ethoxy-2H-chromenes.“ We found that chromene acetals substituted at the 5- and 6-positions with methoxy (30), methyl (31), fluoro (32), and chloro (33) functionalities are suitable substrates. Attempts to use sterically congested chromene acetals resulted in low reactivity (3-Ph, 34), although a modest yield could be achieved at 100 °C and a PPh;/Ni ratio of 3:1. Notably, aryl chlorides are well tolerated on both reaction partners, allowing for a direct entry toward the antiviral BW683C and providing handles for further func- tionalization by metal-catalyzed cross-coupling (35). Perhaps the most important demonstration of the capa- city of the outlined method is late-stage functionalization of molecules that possess functionality incompatible with existing methods for chromene and ether syntheses. As a validation of the principle, we selected the pharmaceutical drugs loratadine and indomethacin methyl ester, in addi- tion to a known furfuryl-benzotrifluoride, as test sub- strates. Collectively, these substrates possess acidic C-H bonds, Lewis basic heteroatoms, nucleophilic heterocycles, and an aldehyde. Utilizing Molander’s recently disclosed method for the direct synthesis of aryl boronic acids from aryl chlorides,*° we were able to successfully isolate the requisite boronic acids. Under the reaction conditions (26) Molander, G. A.; Trice, S. L. J.; Dreher, S. D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010, 732, 17701-17703. Org. Lett., Vol. 14, No. 6, 2012 described for heteroaryl substrates, the desired coupling occurred in 26—79% yield (Figure 2, 29, and Scheme 2, 36 and 37). Importantly, these compounds would be impos- sible to construct by methods that involved strong bases at any stage of the chromene synthesis, including the addition of Grignard reagents to chromene acetals.

In conclusion, we have reported a modular synthesis of 2-aryl and 2-heteroaryl 2H-chromene derivatives from readily available chromene acetals that is characterized by a broad scope, mild conditions, and an inexpensive metal/ligand system. The reaction also represents the first example of a transition-metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction between allylic acetals and boronic acids. Experi- ments to delineate the generality of this acid and base-free strategy for the construction of ethers will be the focus of our future efforts. Acknowledgment.

Heated oil baths were used for reactions requiring elevated temperatures. Solvents were removed under reduced pressure at 40-65 °C using a rotavapor. All given yields are isolated yields of chromatographically and NMR spectroscopically materials. All commercially available chemicals were used as received without further purification. Solvents as follows: MeOH, EtOH, toluene, DMF, EtOAc, DCM, hexane, THF, acetone and 1,4-dioxane were used without further purification. The 'H and ‘°C NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 on 400 MHz and 100 MHz instruments with TMS as internal standard. For referencing of the 'H NMR spectra, the residual solvent signal (6 = 7.26 for CDCls) was used. In the case of the ‘SC NMR spectra, the signal of solvents (5 = 77.06 + 0.03 for CDCls and 6 = 39.52 for DMSO-de) were reported in ppm with respect to TMS. Data are represented as follows: chemical shift, multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, m = multiplet), coupling constant (J, Hz), and integration. MALDI-TOF analyses were carried out using an ABI/MDS SCIEX 4800 Mass Spectrometer with HABA matrix. UV-Vis spectra were collected on an Agilent 8453 UV-Visible Spectroscopy system. Fluorescence data were collected by using cary Eclipse Fluorescence Spectrophotometer and Eclipse ADL program. GPC data were collected by using TOSOH EcoSEC HLC-8320 GPC equipped with a dual-flow refractive index detector. A UV detector is also included for UV visible polymers and can be used in tandem with the RI detector. The installed columns have a range of 500-10’ Da. Samples were run for 30 minutes with flow rate 1.001 mL/min. Polystyrene (PS) standards were used for calibration in our experiments. X-ray data were collected on a Rigaku XtaLAB Synergy-/ Kappa diffractometer equipped with a PhotonJet-/ X-ray source operated at 50 W (50kV, 1 mA) to generate Cu Ka radiation (A = 1.54178 A) and a HyPix-6000HE HPC detector. Crystals were transferred from the vial and placed on a glass slide in polyisobutylene. A Zeiss Stemi 305 microscope was used to identify a suitable specimen for X-ray diffraction from a representative sample of the material. The crystal and a small amount of the oil were collected on a MiTeGen 100 micron cryoloop and transferred to the instrument where it was placed under a cold nitrogen stream (Oxford 700 series) at 100K.The sample was optically centered with the aid of a video camera to ensure that no translations were observed as the crystal was rotated through all positions. A unit cell collection was then S2	Paper7_SI	2	375	855	2105	3233

The crystal was measured for size, morphology, and color. The chiral polymer samples were coated with a thin gold layer by sputtering, and a NANOSCIENCE Phenom ProX scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Phoenix, AZ, USA) was used to observe the morphological characteristics. The CD measurements were carried out using a Jasco J-815 spectrometer equipped with a Peltier MPTC-490S temperature-controlled cell holder unit. A 200-uL chiral polymer sample at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL in HPLC gradient methanol was placed in a 1 mm quartz cuvette on the temperature-controlled cell holder. CD spectra were collected using Jasco Spectra measurement version 2 software for a wavelength range of 190-400 nm with a data pitch of 0.1 nm using a bandwidth of 1 nm and scanning speed of 100 nm/min. Each spectrum was corrected by subtraction with corresponding methanol background. S3	Paper7_SI	3	376	309	2105	3233

To help maintain reasonable ADP values and bond lengths, RIGU, SIMU and AFIX 66 restraints and constraints were applied to the disordered sites. Hydrogen atoms bound to carbon and nitrogen atoms were geometrically constrained using the appropriate AFIX commands.	Paper7_SI	18	375	504	2106	2999

These copolymers were characterised by optical and electrochemical methods and used in the fabrication of light-emitting diodes. We find that upon increasing the conjugation length of the B moiety, from a thiophene unit to 2,5-bis(2’-vinyl thienyl)thiophene, the fluorescence quantum yields are reduced both in solution (from 51 to 11%) and in solid state. Both absorption and emission are red-shifted, with the solid state emission maximum increasing from 476 nm (green) to 600 nm (orange). When the B unit is changed from thiophene to thiophene-S,S-dioxide, there is a significant increase in both the ionisation potential and electron affinity, and a concurrent reduction of the solution fluorescence efficiency (down to 16%). These polymers appear promising materials for optoelectronic applications. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. Keywords: Polyfluorene; Copolymers; Light-emitting polymers 1. Introduction Polyfluorenes are presently the most attractive class of organic semiconducting materials for optoelectronic appli- cations, such as long-lived polymeric full colour displays. They combine high chemical and photochemical stability with high luminescence efficiencies [1,2]. Furthermore, they have the capability to emit in the blue region of the visible spectrum as well as to allow a broad tunability of emission when copolymerised with low band gap monomers [3]. This copolymerisation approach is also an effective tool to alter the energetic position of the frontier levels [3], ionisation potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA), which are relevant for charge injection. We note that the control of charge injection into the electroluminescent (EL) polymer is of paramount importance for the preparation of highly efficient light-emitting diodes (LEDs). We have previously shown that the S,S-dioxide substitution on the thiophene moiety of a fluorene—-thiophene alternating copolymer is effective at increasing both IP and EA [4]. In this communication, we report on the properties of well-defined alternating copoly- mers of the same type, A-alt-B, where A is 9,9-bis(2’- ethylhexyl)fluorene and B is an extended thiophene-based “Corresponding author.

Copoly- mers were precipitated by the addition of the reaction mixture to methanol under stirring. The collected solid was purified by dissolution in a minimum amount of CHCl, filtration of the solution and precipitation into methanol. This dissolution/precipitation purification procedure was repeated two more times. The copolymers were finally dried under vacuum. Their chemical and structural characterisa- tion was performed by elemental analysis (C, H, S), FT-IR,	Paper1_Thiophene_2002	1	1273	2383	2268	3068

Ca cathodes were thermally evaporated at ca. 5 x 10~° mbar (pixel area ~2 mm?) and protected with an overlayer of Al. The devices were tested under vacuum (ca. 5 x 107? mbar). 3. Results and discussion We obtained well defined and soluble copolymers in reasonably good yields (47-58%, after purification). Their molecular weight and polydispersity (PDI) (see Table 1) are typical of the palladium-catalysed Suzuki-type polymerisa- tion [10]. The lower molecular weight of PF3T and PFBTVT is due to their low solubility in the reaction mixture, which lead to their precipitation during the polymerisation reac- tion. According to the FT-IR spectra, the vinylene units between the thiophene rings in PFBTVT are mostly in trans configuration, as indicated by the relative intensity of the bands assigned to the CH vibration, occurring at 930 cm~', for the trans, and at 700 cm7' for the cis configurations. A similar relative intensity is found in the synthesised monomer 2,5-bis(2’-bromo-5-vinyl thienyl)thiophene.

279	-1	Solution fluorescence quantum yields were determined in CHCl, dilute solutions (OD < 0.1) by comparison of the spectrally integrated fluorescence spectra with those of an adequate standard [6]. Details will be reported elsewhere [5]. PFT and PF3T were excited at their absorption maximum (408 and 440 nm, respectively), whereas PFTSO2 and PFBTVT, were excited at the maximum of the lowest energy band of the absorption spectra. Solid state fluorescence (or photoluminescence, PL) quantum yields were determined using an integrating sphere, upon excitation with the blue line (442 nm) of a He—Cd laser, according to the procedure reported by de Mello et al. [7]. The IP and the EA of the copolymers are shown in Table 1. As we reported in a previous publication [4], the S,S-dioxide functionalisation of the thiophene ring leads to a stabilisa- tion of the frontier levels, as inferred from the increase of both IP and EA in going from PFT to PFTSO2. This is in	Paper1_Thiophene_2002	2	211	1392	2305	2574
280	-1	The electrochemical properties were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), using a tetra-n-butylammonium tetra- fluoroborate/CH3CN supporting electrolyte, at a scan rate of 50 mV/s. A saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) (calibrated against ferrocene, Fc/Fe* 0.41 V), a platinum wire as counter electrode and a platinum disc as working electrode were used. As the energy level of Fc/Fc* is estimated to lie at 4.8 eV below the vacuum level [8], we calculate the IP and the EA, as IP (eV) = Fors + 4.39 and EA (eV) = Epyt' + 4.39, respectively.

[11] on the effect of such functionalisation in oligothio- phenes. The increase of the thiophene-based moiety exten- sion, in the series PFT, PF3T and PFBTVT, leads instead, to a decrease of the IP, whereas the EA is not significantly altered. A similar decrease of the IP was reported by Donat-Bouillud et al. [12], for an alternating copolymer, when a dithienylene, instead of a thienylene unit, is com- bined with 9,9-dioctylfluorene. decreases, from 49 to 30%, if a dithienylene unit, instead of a thienylene unit, is copolymerised with 9,9-dioctylfluorene. A strong reduction of the solution PL efficiency is also observed upon S,S-dioxide functionalisation of the thio- phene unit: ®p,(PFTSO2) = 16%, while ®p.(PFT) = 51%. For all polymers shown in Table 1, a strong reduction of fluorescence quantum yields is observed on going from solution to the solid state, exhibiting PF3T the highest solid state Pp, (8.1%). This luminescence quenching is associated to the interchain interactions and/or the increase of deloca- lisation, with the concomitant increase of excitons mobility and their probability of finding quenching sites [14]. On going from solution to solid state, we also find a red-shift of both the absorption spectra onset and of PL spectra. The shift of the PL spectra is not accompanied by a significant change of the spectral distribution. Among the four polymers, such a shift is more pronounced for PF3T, for which the PL spectrum is shifted by about 55 nm, whereas the shift of the absorption-onset is about 20 nm. This red-shift is attrib- uted to a more planar molecular conformation in solid state, brought about by intermolecular interactions and packing mainly induced by the thiophene-based moiety. This increase of planarity in going from solution to solid state is also consistent with the observed smaller red-shift of both PL and absorbance of PFBTVT (in relation to PF3T). Due to the presence of the vinyl unit between the thiophene rings, we expect the steric hindrance to be reduced and a more planar conformation to be favoured even in solution, leading to a less pronounced red-shift when going to the solid state. Fig. 3 shows current—voltage and light intensity—voltage characteristics for LEDs based on PF3T and PFBTVT. The electroluminescence, EL, spectra, shown in Fig. 3, are similar to the corresponding PL spectra, indicating that the same excited state is responsible for light-emission.	Paper1_Thiophene_2002	3	177	201	2271	2720
282	-1	The optical energy gap values, E, (see Table 1), estimated from the onset of the solid state UV-visible absorption spectra (Fig. 2A), exhibit also a systematic decrease with the extension of the thiophene-based moiety, more specifi- cally in going from PFT to PF3T and to PFBTVT, from 2.5 down to 2.2 eV. Such decrease reflects the importance of the conjugation length of the B unit (Fig. 1), despite the lower molecular weight. We further note that the existence of trans vinylene groups between the thiophene units in BTVT is expected to favour a more planar (delocalised) structure in relation to 3T, contributing to the reduction of E,. Quite interestingly, the SO, functionalisation of the thiophene unit leads to a similar decrease of E, down to 2.2 eV. A similar red-shift of the absorption spectra, due to this functionalisa- tion, was previously reported by Barbarella et al. [11] for oligothiophenes. As shown in Fig. 2B, the PL spectra of PF3T and PFBTVT are increasingly red-shifted in relation to that of PFT, as expected form the observed red-shift of the absorption features. Solution fluorescence quantum yields, given in Table 1, decrease in the same series PFT, PF3T, PFBTVT, that is with the increase of conjugation of the thiophene-based moiety. This variation is likely to be asso- ciated to a lower intrinsic probability of the radiative decay (for example, due to higher intersystem crossing, ISC) although the occurrence of a higher exciton quenching resulting from a higher intra-chain mobility cannot be ruled out. Due to the low concentration of these solutions (<10~° M, based on the repeat unit), the effect of aggrega- tion (either in the ground or excited states) is not expected to contribute to the observed reduction of fluorescence effi- ciency. These results are in agreement with the report by Ranger and Leclerc [13] that the solution PL efficiency External EL efficiencies are in the order of 4 x 107*% for the PF3T and of 2 x 10-3% for PFBTVT. This is not unexpected considering the low solid state PL efficiencies. However, we believe that there is still room for improvement of these EL efficiencies, either using multilayer structures or by doping these polymers with charge transport molecules/ polymers.

Conclusions A series of novel alternating copolymers of the type A-alt- B, where A is 9,9-bis(2'-ethylhexyl)fluorene and B is a thiophene-based moiety, was synthesised. We find that we can tune the emission colour from green to orange, by increasing the extent of conjugation of the B unit, from a thiophene to 2,5-bis(2’-vinyl thienyl)thiophene, though at the expense of a fluorescence efficiency reduction. Among the B units we have used, the S,S-dioxide functionalisation of the thiophene promotes an increase of both IP and EA, with respect to the use of a single thiophene unit, that makes the polymer interesting, especially for improving electron injection from stable cathodes. The functionalisation also reduces the optical energy gap to 2.2 eV, the same value that we find for PFBTVT. We have reported EL from non- optimised, single-layer LEDs based on such polymers and we note that these materials are also interesting candidates for other optoelectronic devices, such as photovoltaic cells.

The utility of the method to the discovery of potent agrochemicals is presented. Considering the importance of 2-pyridines and the versatility of N—C activation methods, we envision The current shortcomings in the development of synthetic approaches to 2-arylpyridines have led to defining the “2- pyridyl problem” in the cross-coupling of pyridyl derivatives as nucleophilic coupling partners (Figure 1B). Although organo- metallic reagents at the 2 position of the pyridine ring are easily available, the 2-pyridyl—metal bond is prone to protodemeta- lation, rendering this pathway extremely challenging. Although this challenge can be circumvented by a polarity reversal in the cross-coupling using halopyridines, these substrates are less attractive in medicinal chemistry and agrochemistry research because this approach relies on the availability of prefunctionalized and highly reactive sub- strates.”	Paper10_2-Pyridines_2023	1	213	1280	2314	2880

289	-1	With the optimized conditions in hand, the scope of this cross-coupling was examined (Scheme 1). We first focused on the scope of boronic acids. The reactions were performed using the two most reactive catalysts identified in the optimization studies, namely, [Pd(IPr)(3-CF;-An)Cl,] and [Pd(IPr)(cin)Cl]. We found that the scope of boronic acids is very broad and encompasses various electron-neutral (3a), electron-rich (3b and 3c), and electron-deficient (3d—3h) boronic acids. Importantly, fluorinated motifs that are privileged in medicinal chemistry and agrochemistry~’ can be readily installed using this method (3d—3f). Furthermore, the method is well-compatible with sensitive electrophiles that would be problematic using hard organometallics (3g and 3h). Furthermore, steric hindrance (3j) and meta-substitution (3k and 31) are well-tolerated. Interestingly, we found that, for some substrates, [Pd(IPr)(3-CF;-An)Cl,] is the preferred catalyst, while in other examples, [Pd(IPr)(cin)Cl] gave higher yields. We performed kinetic studies to gain insight into the rate of catalyst activation (see the Supporting Information) and found that [Pd(IPr)(3-CF;-An)Cl,] is a faster activating catalyst, while [Pd(IPr)(cin)Cl] is slightly preferred for the reversed stoichiometry of boronic acid. These results highlight the importance of testing various Pd(II)—-NHC precatalysts with different classes of ancillary ligands, where the overall reaction outcome depends upon catalyst activation, stability, and cross-coupling efficiency. The effect of [Pd(IPr)(3-CF3- Next, we evaluated the scope of heteroaryl boronic acids to furnish pyridine heterobiaryls (Scheme 2). Notably, we found that this reaction is compatible with a broad range of heterocycles, including differently substituted thiophenes (3m and 3n), furans (30 and 3p), pyridines (3q and 3r), pyrimidines (3s—3u), pyrroles (3v), pyrazoles (3w), isoxazoles (3x), benzothiophenes (3y and 3z), benzofurans (3aa and 3ab), quinolines (3ac), and dibenzofurans (3ad). It is particularly noteworthy that this method allows for the synthesis of valuable heterobiaryls that are ubiquitous in medicinal chemistry and agrochemistry research. We found that [Pd(IPr)(cin)Cl] is preferred for substrate scope in this case using reverse stoichiometry of boronic acids.	Paper10_2-Pyridines_2023	4	214	1155	2318	3144
290	-1	Finally, we also evaluated the scope of 2-pyridyl ammonium salts (Scheme 3). These substrates are readily available by Chichibabin 2-amination and N-alkylation, enabling a combined C—H/N-—C bond activation. This new process is well-compatible with various electron-rich (3ae—3ag, 3aj—3al, and 3ao0—3aq) and electron-deficient (3ah, 3ai, 3am, 3an, and 3ar—3au) substituents on the pyridine ring to furnish valuable pyridine heterobiaryls that serve as prominent motifs in drug discovery and agrochemistry research. The functional group tolerance, including esters, ketones, carbamates, amines, as well as a range of various electron-rich and electron-deficient five- and six-membered heterocycles, should be noted. As expected, the method is no compatible with aryl chlorides and bromides.'” We anticipate that even higher levels of reaction selectivity will be possible through NHC ligand tuning.'>'° Interestingly, 3-amino-pyridyl ammonium salts are not compatible, as expected from electronic delocalization.”” Studies to expand the scope by facilitating oxidative addition of unconjugated substrates are currently underway.

292	-1	One of the most important applications of 2-arylpyridine motifs is in the synthesis of novel agrochemicals. We showcased the utility of this process in the design of a new family of potent antifungal agents by “scaffold hopping” of inverse 2-pyridyl-indoles (Scheme 6).”' The antifungal activity was assessed against five species of pathogenic fungi (Table 3). Compound 3ay showed excellent activity against all tested fungi, superseding those of antifungal agent Su and commercial fungicide boscalid. Thus, this C-H/N-—C activation is an attractive method for the discovery of new pesticides with potent efficacy.

293	-1	In summary, we have reported the first Suzuki—Miyaura cross-coupling of 2-pyridyl ammonium salts catalyzed by air- and moisture-stable Pd(II)—-NHC precatalysts. The reaction shows broad compatibility with various functional groups and heterocycles, allowing for rapid access to valuable biaryl and heterobiaryl pyridines that are among the most common motifs in organic synthesis. Considering the predominance of the 2-aryl pyridine core in organic synthesis, we expect that this activation strategy will find broad application.

Experimental Procedures and Characterization Data General Procedure for the Suzuki-Miyaura Cross-Coupling of (Pyridin-2- yl)trimethylammonium Salts. An oven-dried vial equipped with a stir bar was charged with a (pyridin-2-yl)trimethylammonium salt substrate (2.0 equiv), Cs2CO3 (typically, 2.0 equiv), boronic acid (1.0 equiv), Pd-NHC catalyst (typically, 10 mol%), placed under a positive pressure of argon, and subjected to three evacuation/backfilling cycles under high vacuum. Dioxane (typically, 0.2 M) and water (typically, 5.0 equiv) were added with vigorous stirring at room temperature, the reaction mixture was placed in a preheated oil bath at 60 °C and stirred for the indicated time. After the indicated time, the reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature, diluted with EtOAc (10 mL), filtered, and concentrated. The sample was analyzed by 'H NMR (CDCl, 500 MHz) and GC-MS to obtain conversion, selectivity and yield using internal standard and comparison with authentic samples.

353	-1	Suzuki-Miyaura Cross-Coupling of 2-Pyridyl Ammonium Salts by N—C Activation Hu et al. Antifungal Activities General Procedure. The in vitro antifungal activities against five pathogenic fungi (Rhizoctonia solani, Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium graminearum, Valsa mali, and Alternaria solani) were determined using mycelium growth rate method.” All of the tested compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and the required concentrations were prepared using double dilution method. The test solutions with series of concentrations were poured into sterile petri dishes (D = 90 mm) to obtain drug-containing potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates. A 5 mm puncher of the activated test fungi was inoculated on the above-mentioned PDA plates, and then incubated in a 25 °C incubator. Solutions with the same concentrations of DMSO, and boscalid were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. The diameter of the tested colony was measured with the cross method, and each experiment was run in triplicate. Inhibition rates (IR) were calculated according to the formula as follows: IR (%) = (AO — A1)/(A0 — 5) x 100 where AO and A1 are the colony growth diameters (mm) on the untreated and treated PDA plates, respectively.

Ar-flushed stainless steel cannulae or gas-tight syringes were used to transfer air- and moisture-sensitive reagents. Solvent was freshly distilled/degassed prior to use unless otherwise noted. Reactions were monitored by LCMS. Organic solutions were concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator (30 °C, <50 torr). Automated column chromatography was performed using pre-packed silica gel cartridges on a Biotage SP4 (40-53 um, 60 A). Materials. Commercial reagents were used as received with the following exceptions. 4-CF,- phenylboronic acid, 4-MeO-phenyl boronic acid and phenyl boronic acid were recrystallized from water and stored on the benchtop. |,4-dioxane (inhibitor free, ACS reagent grade >99%), and toluene (ACS reagent grade, >99%) were freshly distilled from Na under an atmosphere of dry N, prior to use. Anhydrous 2-methyl-2-butanol (t-AmOH, | L Sure/Seal""' bottle) was purchased from Aldrich and sparged with N, for 30 min under sonication prior to use. Ni(cod), was purchased from Strem and stored at —40 °C in a N, filled glovebox. Triphenylphosphine was purchased from Strem and stored in a N,j filled glovebox. Instrumentation. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance ('H NMR) spectra and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (‘°C NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker 500 AVANCE spectrometer (500 and 125 MHz, respectively). Chemical shifts for protons are reported in parts per million downfield from tetramethylsilane and are referenced to residual protium in the NMR solvent (CHC|, = 6 7.26). Chemical shifts for carbon are reported in parts per million downfield from tetramethylsilane and are referenced to the carbon resonances of the solvent residual peak (CDCI; = 8 77.16 ppm). '’F spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova 300 (282 MHz) spectrometer; chemical shifts are reported in parts per millions and are referenced to CFCI; (6 0 ppm). NMR data are represented as follows: chemical shift (6 ppm), multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, m = multiplet), coupling constant in Hertz (Hz), integration. FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Paragon 500 and are reported in terms of frequency of absorption (crv'). LCMS was performed on an Agilent 1260 series instrument with a multimode detector (APCI/ESI). Prep HPLC was performed on an Agilent Prep-star with single wavelength UV detector."

Procedure for preparation of 2-aryl and 2-heteroaryl-2H-|-benzopyrans General procedure: A 2-dram vial equipped with a PTFE-coated stir-bar and PTFE-tape-lined screw-thread was brought into a N, filled glovebox, charged with Ni(cod), (13.6 mg, 0.05 mmol, 10 mol%) and PPh; (13 mg, 0.05 mmol, 10 mol%; or 30 mol%). |,4-dioxane (| mL) was added via micropipette and the resulting orange suspension stirred until complete dissolution (15 min, dark blood red solution was formed). The vial was tightly sealed with a PTFE-lined screw-cap and the vial further sealed with electrical tape. It was removed from the glovebox and placed on an N, line. A 50 mL pear-shaped Schlenk flask equipped with a PTFE-coated stir-bar was charged with 2- ethoxy-2H-chromene (88 mg, 0.50 mmol, or appropriate amount of substituted chromene acetal) and the appropnate arylboronic acid (1.00 mmol, 2 equiv.). The flask was sealed with a rubber septum and subjected to 3-4 evac/purge cycles (~45 sec per cycle). The flask was then charged with |,4-dioxane (23 mL, freshly distilled from Na) and t-AmOH (2 mL, degassed by sparging with N, in a sonicator bath for 15-30 min) to give a homogenous solution (0.02M with respect to chromene acetal) (Some boronic acids did not completely dissolve. Reactivity/reproducibility was not affected.). The catalyst solution was then added via syringe and the resulting orange/yellow solution stirred at the appropriate temperature (rt, 40 °C, or 100 °C) until complete conversion of 2-ethoxy-2H-chromene or stagnation was observed by LCMS. After this time, the reaction mixture was concentrated and the crude subjected to flash chromatography. Ce Te NHAc Prepared according to the general procedure (rt. 10 mol% PPh;, complete conversion by LCMS after 2 h), the title compound was isolated as a yellow gum (Run |: | 17 mg, 88%; Run 2: 117 mg 88%).

Procedure for gram scale synthesis of 2-phenyl-2H-|-benzopyran A 25-mL RBF equipped with a PTFE-coated stir-bar was brought into a N, filled glovebox, charged with Ni(cod), (137 mg, 0.50 mmol, 5 mol%) and PPh; (13! mg, 0.50 mmol). |,4-dioxane (6 mL) was added via micropipette and the resulting orange suspension stirred until mostly homogenous (15 min, dark blood red solution was formed). The flask was tightly sealed with a rubber septum and further sealed with electrical tape. It was removed from the glovebox and placed on an N, line. 2-ethoxy-2H-chromene (10 mmol, |.76 g) was transferred to a N,-flushed 100 mL pear-shaped Schlenk flask and degassed (15 min, N, sparge, with stirring). PhB(QH), (20 mmol, 2.43 g) was quickly added and the flask subjected to three evac/purge cycles with N>. The mixture was dissolved (46 ml |,4-dioxane, 4 ml t-AmOH, 0.2M with respect to 2-ethoxy-2H-chromene) and stirred for 30 secs. The blood red catalyst mixture was added via syringe (catalyst flask was rinsed with an additional 2 mL of |,4-dioxane to ensure complete transfer) and the resulting mixture placed into a preheated oil bath (40 °C). After 14 h the reaction appears to stagnate (no further conversion of SM is observed by LCMS). The reaction mixture is directly concentrated and subjected to column chromatography (100 g silica, O->20% CH,Cl,/hexanes) to give a mixed fraction containing 4-phenyl-4H-1|-benzopyran (1,4 adduct) and 2-phenyl-2H-|-benzopyran (1,2 adduct) (250 mg, 3:1 ratio by 'H NMR) followed by a clean fraction containing the desired product (1,2 adduct) (1.47 g, >20:1 rr) (overall yield of 1.72 g, 8:1 rr, 85%). | ,2-adduct: Se TT Matches previously recorded information.

O 4 (HO).B CF3 A 100 mL pear-shaped schlenk flask fitted with a magnetic stirbar was sequentially charged with 5- (2-Chloro-5-trifluoromethylphenyl)furfural (1.37 g, 5.00 mmol), 2-amino-biphenyl Pd-xXPhos precatalyst (78.5 mg, 0.10 mmol, 2 mol%), XPhos (95.0 mg, 0.20 mmol, 4 mol%), B,(OH), (672 mg, 7.50 mmol, 1.5 eq), KOAc (1.47 g, 15.0 mmol, 3.0 eq), NaOtBu (9.0 mg, 0.10 mmol, 2 mol%) and the vessel sealed with rubber septum. The vessel was subject to 3 evac/purge cycles with N, and then charged with 50 mL of EtOH (previously degassed with sonication under a N, sparge, 20 mins). The resulting mixture was placed into a pre heated oil bath (80 °C) and aged with vigorous stirring. After 2.5 h LCMS analysis indicates the complete consumption of starting material ([M-F]= 256, negative ionization mode, APCI/ES!) with formation of product ([M-H+HCO,H]=329, negative ionization mode, APCI/ESI) and production of two unidentified major side products ([M] =331, and [M]=568). The reaction mixture is cooled to rt. and filtered through a short pad of celite. The resulting mixture is taken up in 100 mL IN HCI/EtOAc (1:1 v/v) and stirred for 5 min. The layers are separated, and the organic phase washed with brine. Combined aqueous phases were extracted (1x50 mL, EtOAc) and the resulting organic layers combined and dried (Na,SO,). After concentration under reduced pressure, the resulting orange foam is taken up in a minimal amount of MeCN and applied to a slurry packed column of C18 silica (50:50 MeCN:H,O) and eluted (50:50 MeCN:H,©O) to give 4 bright yellow fractions (~50 mL each). The first two fractions are combined and concentrated slowly under reduced pressure. Once the MeCN is removed a yellow slurry results with small amount of orange oil (failure to remove this impurity prevents successful execution of the next step). The orange oil is decanted and the yellow slurry concentrated to give an amorphous soild that is contaminated with unidentified impurities (LCMS). The resulting solid is suspended in 2 mL of MTBE:hexanes (1:1 v/v) and stirred for 5 minutes. The bright yellow/orange suspension is allowed to settle and the solvent decanted. The process is repeated and the resulting fine yellow powder is washed once with hexanes and dried under high vacuum to give the desired product (350 mg, ~25% yield).

In line with previous knowledge, we have observed that commercial samples frequently contain varying amounts of boroxine and boronic acid. The initial ratios of nucleophile were determined by removing a small aliquot from the reaction mixture prior to the addition of the catalyst solution. The aliquot was concentrated and then analyzed by 'H NMR. The reaction progress was monitored by LCMS, and was determined to be complete when 2-ethoxy-2H-chromene could no longer be detected (<2LCAP).

444	-1	Lee, Gray, Paek, and Burke General Experimental Procedures. All palladium-mediated cross-coupling reactions were set up in a glove box and performed under an atmosphere of argon or nitrogen in oven- or flame-dried I-Chem or Wheaton vials sealed with PTFE-lined plastic caps unless otherwise indicated. All other reactions were performed in oven- or flame-dried round-bottom or modified Schlenk flasks fitted with rubber septa under a positive pressure of argon or nitrogen unless otherwise indicated. Organic solutions were concentrated via rotary evaporation under reduced pressure. Reactions were monitored by analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) performed using the indicated solvent on E. Merck silica gel 60 F254 plates (0.25 mm). Compounds were visualized by exposure to a UV lamp (A = 254 and 365 nm), a solution of KMnO,, a solution of ceric ammonium molybdate (CAM), or an acidic solution of p-anisaldehyde followed by brief heating using a Varitemp heat gun. Flash column chromatography was performed as described by Still and coworkers’? using EM Merck silica gel 60 (230-400 mesh) and/or Aldrich Florisil® (an activated magnesium silicate: 100-200 mesh). Structural Analysis. 'H NMR spectra were recorded at 23 °C on one of the following instruments: Varian Unity 400, Varian Unity 500, Varian Unity Inova 5OONB. Chemical shifts (6) are reported in parts per million (ppm) downfield from tetramethylsilane and referenced to residual protium in the NMR solvent (CDCl,, 6 = 7.26; CD,CN, 5 = 1.93; (CD,),CO, 6 = 2.04; DMSO-d,, 5 = 2.49, center line). Data are reported as follows: chemical shift, multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, qn = quintet, sext = sextet, dd = doublet of doublets, dt = doublet of triplets, ddt = doublet of doublet of triplets, dtd = doublet of triplet of doublets, m = multiplet, br = broad), coupling constant (J) in Hertz (Hz), and integration. Based on 'H NMR analysis, unless otherwise indicated the isomeric purity of all olefin- containing compounds was judged to be >95:5 E:Z ('H and '°C NMR spectra of all compounds are provided in SI.B). MIDA boronates were judged to be stable to long-term storage based on the observation of no change 'H NMR spectra after the indicated time. ('H NMR spectra of BB, and 14 collected both before and after storage on the benchtop under air for 1 year and 5 months are included in SI.B). °C NMR spectra were recorded at 23 °C on one of the following instruments: Varian Unity 400, Varian Unity 500 or Varian Unity Inova 500. Chemical shifts (6) are reported in ppm downfield from tetramethylsilane and referenced to carbon resonances in the NMR solvent (CDCL, 6 = 77.0; CD,CN, 6 = 1.30; (CD,;),CO, 5 = 29.8; DMSO-d,, 5 = 39.5, center line).

445	-1	In a subdued light environment, an oven-dried 100 mL one-neck round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar and a rubber septum was flushed with acetylene gas three-times using a five-inch balloon attached to a needle. The flask was attached to three balloons filled with acetylene gas and cooled to 0 °C. To the flask at 0 °C was added boron tribromide (75.0 g, 299.4 mmol) dropwise via syringe over 15 min with stirring. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to 23 °C and then stirred at 23 °C for 24 hr. (Each balloon was refilled with acetylene gas after the acetylene gas in the balloon was consumed; if a needle became clogged during the reaction mixture it was replaced with a new one). The resulting dark- blue crude mixture was distilled three-times under high vacuum connected with two dry ice/acetone traps to provide 3 (45.20 g, 163.4 mmol) as a colorless oil in 55 % yield. (bp = 50-55 °C/13 mmHg). (The fractional vacuum distillation was carried out at 23 °C for 30 minutes before heating to remove a small amount of residual boron tribromide and then the crude mixture was slowly heated to around 65 °C using an oil-bath until distillation was completed. The oil-bath temperature was carefully maintained below 70 °C to inhibit a polymerization reaction). The triply distilled title compound 3 was used immediately in the next reaction. This reaction was conducted in a subdued light environment in an oven-dried 500 mL three-neck round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar. To a stirred mixture of N-methyliminodiacetic acid (MIDA, 2) (16.93 g, 113.9 mmol, 1.50 eq.) and 2,6-lutidine (17.69 mL, 151.86 mmol, 2.0 eq.) in DMSO (250 mL) at 0 °C under nitrogen was added freshly distilled 3 (21.00 g, 75.93 mmol) dropwise via syringe over 15 min.

A novel class of polymers and oligomers of chiral folding chirality has been designed and synthesized, showing structurally compacted triple-column/multiple-layer frameworks. Both uniformed and differentiated aromatic chromophoric units were successfully constructed between naphthyl piers of this framework. Screening monomers, catalysts, and catalytic systems led to the success of asymmetric catalytic Suzuki-Miyaura polycouplings. Enantio- and diastereochemistry were unambiguously determined by X-ray structural analysis and concurrently by comparison with a similar asymmetric induction by the same catalyst in the asymmetric synthesis of a chiral three-layered product. The resulting chiral polymers exhibit intense fluorescence activity in a solid form and solution under specific wavelength irradiation. 1. Introduction The search for desired and challenging properties of mate- rials heavily depends on the molecular design and synthesis of monomers and polymers [1-10]. The discovery and development of new polymers, especially conductive poly- mers, have become one of the most active topics in modern materials science in the past several decades [11-17]. The properties of conductive polymers are mainly attributed to the electronic flexibility conjugated through their carbon- carbon double and triple bonds of the backbones of their frameworks [18-20]. In addition to electronic delocalization, through-space conjugation has emerged as an alternative pathway for energy and charge transfers in polymers [16, 17, 21-23]. For example, a five-layered congener of decked naphthalene-diimides (NDIs) anchored by 1,8-diethynylan- thracene spacers displayed a ten-electron reversible reduc- tion process in a small working potential window (~0.8 V), which is abnormal electronic behavior in organic conductive frameworks. Meanwhile, multiple-layered polymers, such as poly-(dibenzofulvene)s, [2.2]paracyclophane-layered, and 2D multilayered 7-stacked conjugated polymers, have been established and displayed various attractive properties [24]. €Z0Z ‘TI Joquiacaq UO vURIA - sIoUTTI] JO A}ISIOATUA] 1e BIO‘aOUATINS ‘fds//:sdyY WOT popropuMog"	Paper7_3DChiral_2022	1	209	208	2410	2964

In this letter, we would like to report our preliminary results on asymmetric catalytic polymerization accessing novel triple-columned and multiple-layered chiral polymers by searching for efficient chiral catalytic systems under mul- tiple Suzuki-Miyaura cross-couplings (Figure 1(b)). 2. Results In our previous design of multiple-layered 3D polymers, the bridges between column anchors were either symmetrically or nonsymmetrically substituted aromatic rings on their 1,4-position [25]. In the present design, the derivatives of 1,8-dibromonaphthalene were employed as building blocks alternatively together with benzo[c] [1, 2, 5], thiadiazole and benzo[c] [1, 2, 5], and selenodizole scaffolds [26]. The resulting polymers in this work displayed different arrange- ments by layered-column anchors in which a long-distance existed between each pair of anchor planes than that of pre- vious ones. This phenomenon was due to an extra naphtha- lene ring inserted between each pair of anchor planes.	Paper7_3DChiral_2022	4	209	185	2410	3104

The retrosynthetic analysis (RSA) [27] was conducted by using 1A as a representative through disconnections into two pairs of synthons (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). The purpose of selecting thiadiazole synthon for this polymerization was based on the fact that it had been among the most frequently employed scaffolds in polymers and materials science, espe- cially in the field of conductive polymers. The synthesis of the monomer of 8,8'-dibromo-1,1'-binaphthalene was very challenging since one of the critical steps involved the cross-coupling between _—2-(8-bromonaphthalen-1-yl)- 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane and _ 1-bromo-8- iodonaphthalene taking about two weeks in a poor yield [28]. Therefore, the first synthon pair was excluded tempo- rarily. We, therefore, chose the second synthon pair for the present asymmetric catalytic polymerization. containing bridges were electron-deficient aromatics in the middle of column anchors, their surrounding layers varied from neutral aromatic ring (naphthalene moiety) to electron- enriched moieties with two MeO-/EtO- groups. These differentiated-layer arrangements would benefit the search for challenging properties of materials, such as optoelectronics, photovoltaics, and polarized organic electronics, etc. €Z0Z ‘TI Joquiacaq UO vURIA - sIoUTTI] JO A}ISIOATUA] 1e BIO‘aOUATINS ‘fds//:sdyY WOT popropuMog	Paper7_3DChiral_2022	5	209	185	2410	2315
514	-1	The comonomer 1 was synthesized starting from 4,7- bis(8-bromonaphthalen-1-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadizole [26, 29] through the Miyaura borylation reaction in a yield of 65%. Selenodiazole derivative two served as an additional basic skeleton which was achieved by following the reported procedure with 47% yield (Scheme 1) [19, 23]. Methylation/ ethylation of naphthalene-1,8-diol, followed by bromination with NBS in the presence of pyridine, afforded the target monomers 5 and 6 with a yield of 60% and 75%, respec- tively. The comonomers (3 and 4) were purchased from commercial sources and directly employed for the polymer- ization without further purification. The synthetic and analytical results of six types of chiral polymers are summarized in Table 1. At the same time, 1A and 1C showed extremely bad solubility in THF, which made gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis difficult. The other four polymers enabled GPC analysis to be conducted smoothly and showed M,, arranging from 53,136 to 72,321, and M,, from 40,854 to 51,135, respectively (Figure. $13-S16). For cases 1A and 1C, the MALDI-TOF analysis showed the highest molecular weights (M,,) as 2439 and 1533, indicating the existence of nine and five layers in the structures, respectively (Figure 3 and $17).	Paper7_3DChiral_2022	5	209	640	2292	2619
515	-1	Taking 1A as the target, we screened a series of mono- and bisphosphines and Pd-ligand complexes to get the desired polymer. Most of the examined chiral catalysts were proven to be ineffective, giving either no polymer products observed or complex mixtures with no optical rotation, except for Pd(S-BINAP)CL,, which provided the best result with a chem- ical yield of 65% and optical rotation of [a] = —7.1. Our attempt to obtain pure oligomers to conduct X-ray structural analysis had not been successful due to too many compounds coexisting in the resulting mixtures; this made purification extremely difficult. However, major enantiomers’ absolute structure could be compared with a similar enantio- selective induction by the same catalyst of Pd(S-BINAP)CL,. This catalyst generated “S”-shaped multilayer 3D enantiomers compared with the orientation of heterocyclic ring on the bridge in our previous work and was anticipated to give the same asymmetric induction in this polymerization as shown in Figure 4(d) [30]. Interestingly, this catalyst led to a new chi- ral framework containing a pseudocenter chirality and orien- tational/rotational chirality. The The pseudo or pro-chirality center is generated at a phosphorus atom with two identical aryl rings but differentiated by aromatic packing and unpack- ing, respectively. This pseudo or pro-chiral center can be extended to other tetrahedron or polyhedron centers (e.g., C, Si, etc.) including those centers attached by four different groups. The orientation/rotational chirality is realized by atro- pisomeric rotation along axis of the P-C bond which is rein- forced by naphthalenyl ring and three moieties of diarylphosphine oxide scaffolds (two differentiated aromatic rings and one P=O group).

While S- and Se- The diastereochemistry of bridge arrangements of poly- meric products could be readily assigned by X-ray structural analysis of a Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling product con- trolled by the same catalyst of Pd(S-BINAP)CL, as well (Figure 4(d)). In this parallel structural arrangement, steric effects between side rings of naphthalene (bridge) and [1,2,5]thiadiazole could direct the orientation of their dia- stereochemistry. In fact, it was the first time for us to obtain this single crystal of asymmetric catalytic Suzuki-Miyaura cross-couplings participated by two nonsymmetric wings during controlling layered structures.

Compared with benzothiadiazole poly- mers, both peaks of the benzoselenadiazole polymers 2A-2C red-shifted slightly and exhibited two broad absorptions in the range of 285 to 345 nm and 370 to 470nm.

In Figure 4(b), 1A-1C emitted yellow-green fluorescence with maximum emission peaks around 510nm. Obviously, replacing benzothiadiazole fol- damers with benzoselenadiazole counterparts made the maximum fluorescent emission peaks shift toward a long wavelength to 540 nm (2A-2C). exhibited in Figure 5, polymer 1A showed negative Cotton effects in the range of 190-195nm, 197-208nm, 210- 21l1nm, 217-220nm, and 225-238nm, while it showed positive Cotton effects in the range of 195-197nm, 208- 210nm, 211-217nm, 220-225 nm, and >238nm. A similar chiral environment of the polymer backbone can be observed on polymer 1B either, featuring negative Cotton effects centered at about 192nm and 240nm, and gradu- ally turned to the positive Cotton effect, respectively. The Cotton effects from polymers 1C, 2A, 2B, and 2C were less intense than 1A and 2B (Figure S19). The information from the Cotton effects indicates that all chiral polymer products have been controlled consistently in regard to their absolute stereochemistry. €Z0Z ‘TI Joquiacaq UO vURIA - sIoUTTI] JO A}ISIOATUA] 1e BIO‘aOUATINS ‘fds//:sdyY WOT popropuMog	Paper7_3DChiral_2022	6	208	184	2410	2577

In addition, different from the compounds shown in Figures 6(a) and 6(b), some semblable cauliflower-like surface structures can be found in the compounds shown in Figures 6(c) and 6(d). 3. Discussion In summary, we have designed and synthesized a novel class of structurally compacted triple-column/multiple-layer chi- ral 3D folding polymers and oligomers. The resulting chiral polymers contain both uniformed and differentiated aro- matic bridges in the middle of two bridge columns, with their structures determined by the GPC and MALDI-TOF analyses. Corresponding multiple-layered chiral oligomers were proven to exist during the polymerization process, as shown in MALDI-TOF spectra. Absolute stereochemistry (enantio- and diastereochemistry) was assigned by X-ray structural analysis of their monomers and, concurrently, by comparison with a similar asymmetric induction by the same catalyst in our previous asymmetric synthesis of chiral three-layered products. Chiral polymers in this work exhibit fluorescence activity in solid form and solution under spe- cific wavelength irradiation. A series of derivatives based on present chiral polymers will be designed and synthesized, achieving challenging properties in our labs.

Like BB,, 14 is a column- and shelf-stable crystalline solid (stable under air for at least 1.5 years). Finally, Negishi cross-coupling between BB, and the hetero- bismetalated vinylzinc reagent 15!74 yielded lynchpin 16 in a novel triply metal selective (Zn vs Sn and B) reaction.

A direct route to the targeted dienylchloride BBz was envisioned via a concomitant metal- and halogen-selective SM cross-coupling between bisbory- lated olefin 14 and (£)-1-chloro-2-iodoethylene 172? (Scheme 2). Due to the absence of a boron p-orbital,!** we hypothesized that the sp?-hybridized MIDA boronate terminus of 14 would be unreactive relative to the sp?-hybridized pinacol boronic ester. In fact, as shown in Scheme 2, single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the distinct hybridization states of the two boron termini of 14, and a halogen- and boron-selective cross-coupling with 17 yielded the targeted bifunctional diene BB, as a column- and shelf-	Paper9_3-step_2008	1	1326	2556	2323	3089
527	-1	The final targeted polyene building block containing three double bonds (BB3) was prepared via another metal-!?' and halogen- selective cross-coupling between bisfunctionalized reagents 16 and 17 (Scheme 3). Despite containing a potentially sensitive triene moiety, BB; is also both column- and shelf-stable. The B-protected haloalkenylboronic acid BB, was utilized in a highly modular three-step synthesis of retinal from known starting materials (Scheme 4).*° Specifically, the selective SM coupling be- tween BB, and trienylboronic acid 20? yielded the tetraenyl MIDA boronate 21. Notably, although the instability of 20 precludes its isolation in concentrated form, tetraenyl MIDA boronate 21 was isolated via column chromatography as a crystalline solid that can be stored refrigerated for at least 1 month without decomposition. In this vein, the B-protected chlorodienylboronic acid BB2 was employed in a modular, three-step synthesis of (-parinaric acid from readily available starting materials (Scheme 5). Specifically, using a modification of the newly identified conditions for polyenylchlo- ride cross-coupling, a selective pairing between the bifunctional dienylchloride BB, and (E£)-1-butenylboronic acid 24!° yielded the column-stable all-trans trienyl boronate 25. The B-deprotection of 25 was achieved under mild aqueous basic conditions, and subsequent cross-coupling with vinyl iodide 26° yielded B-parinaric acid as a fluorescent solid. In contrast to strategies based on lynchpin-type reagents, '” the cross-coupling of B-protected haloboronic acids has the theoretical capacity for limitless iteration.'4 Harnessing this potential, the synthesis of one-half of the AmB macrolide skeleton via recursive SM coupling, has been achieved (Scheme 6). Specifically, boronic acid 18 was joined with BB, to generate dienylboronate 28. A subsequent series of B-deprotection and coupling of the resulting dienylboronic acid with trienylchloride BB3 yielded column-stable pentaenyl MIDA boronate 29. Finally, taking advantage of the recent discovery in our laboratories that MIDA boronates can be used directly as surrogates for boronic acids under aqueous SM conditions,** a one-pot B-deprotection and cross-coupling with dienylchloride 30!° yielded one-half of the AmB skeleton 31. To the best of our knowledge, this is the longest polyene ever synthesized using the SM reaction. This pathway may ultimately provide the foundation for an efficient and flexible total synthesis of this notoriously challenging natural product.*3	Paper9_3-step_2008	2	228	692	2325	2967
528	-1	Although the strength of C—Cl bonds can make the building blocks that contain them quite stable, it also makes these reagents relatively unreactive toward cross-coupling.”+ Moreover, the struc- tural and stereochemical labilities of polyene frameworks preclude the use of forcing conditions. As a result, to the best of our knowledge, SM cross-coupling between a polyenylchloride and a vinylboronic acid has never been previously reported.”> To over- come this challenge, we extensively surveyed a variety of catalysts with different base and solvent combinations for cross-coupling between BB3 and model substrate (E)-1-pentenylboronic acid 18. Ultimately, it was determined that the use of Pd(OAc),/phosphine 5b!” and Cs2CO; in THF at 45 °C gave good yields of tetraenyl MIDA boronate 19 (Scheme 3).!8 A key feature of the MIDA protective group is its capacity for removal under mild, aqueous basic conditions. !** Given the sensitive nature of polyenylboronic acids,!* the B-deprotection of intermediate 21 presented a rigorous test for this methodology. In the event, this deprotection proceeded smoothly, and subsequent SM coupling of the resulting solution of crude boronic acid with the known B-bromo enal 227’ succeeded in generating the targeted all-trans- retinal. As demonstrated herein, B-protected haloalkenylboronic acid building blocks such as BB;—BB3 have potential for broad utility in the context of total syntheses of polyene natural products.

The compound 5a (Scheme 3) was purified by silica gel column chromatography and well characterized by 1HNMR & LC-MS. The characteristic terminal alkene protons of compound 5a were observed at 5 4.73 & 4.39 as doublet in 1HNMR. Further, compound 5a was subjected to bromination reaction by employing N-bromosuccinimide in DCM solvent at room temperature, however an expected yield was not obtained and many side products were obseved. Therefore we modified the reaction condition by taking 1 equ. of N- bromosuccinimide as well as 1.1 equ. of Et;N at 0 °C which lead to a higher yield of compound 6a. Thus, following these reactions, it is significant to mention that the formation of any di-brominated compound was not observed. The 1HNMR spectrum of the product of the bromination of compound 5a showed a doublet at 6 7.79 (J=15.20 Hz), which is character- istic of an alkene proton adjacent to a nitrogen atom.)

The purification of 8a was carried out by using combi-flash column chromatography, and its identity was confirmed by 1HNMR and MS, as well as comparisons with literature data.??) Furthermore, the com- pound 8a was subjected to second bromination reaction by employing the similar reaction conditions of N-bromosuccini- mide and Et;N (Scheme 3). In the case of the synthesis of compound 13, the reaction was initiated by using commercially available D/L-phenylalanine.HCl (10). Compound 12 was pre- pared by carrying out a literature procedure”! (Scheme 3). The preparation of key boronate ester (compound 13) for both syntheses (Lansiumamide & Alatamide (cis-isomer)) was acheived by reacting compound 12 with _bis(pinacolato) diboron and KOAC in the presence of PdCl,dppf catalyst in 1,4- dioxane and cat. DMSO at 95 °C. The confirmation of compound 13 was performed by LC-MS analysis and used crude compound 13 without purification to next step Suzuki coupling reaction. Further, to obtain the Lansiumamide A- phenylalanine amino acid hybrid (14), we have tried several conditions of Suzuki coupling reactions were tried by changing Pd catalysts, bases, solvents and temperature. The subsequent efforts in conducting different conditions turned out to be ineffective. Finally, the compound 14 was obtained in a significant yield by using the compounds 9a as well as compound 13 in the presence of PdCl,dppf, K;PO, in 1,4- dioxane:H,O at room temperature. Compound 14 was charac- terized by 1H and 13 C NMR spectroscopy, FTIR and HRMS.”2 Having completed the synthesis of the Lansiumamide- amino acid hybrid, we decided to turn our attention to the synthesize Alatamide-phenylalanine amino acid hybrid (15). For the preparation of compound 15, similar synthetic protocol was utilized (Scheme 4). In a similar manner, to get the desired compound 4b, the iodination reaction was performed under N- iodosuccinimide and Et,;N at 0°C condition. The compound 4b alkene protons coupling constant value indicates that, com- pound 4b was in cis-isomeric form and it was charactarized by 1HNMR & LC-MS. Also, this same iodination reaction condition was used for the preparation of compound 8b. Further, to produce compound 5b and the final Alatamide (cis-isomer)- phenylalanine amino acid hybrid (15), the Suzuki coupling reaction consisting of two steps (Scheme 4; steps 4 and 6) was achieved by using the compound 7b, compound 13 under PdCl,dppf, K3;PO, in 1,4-dioxane:H,0 condition at RT. The compound 5b was established by 1HNMR and LC-MS. The results found that spectral values of compound 5b were compared with previous report’? and showed the stereo- chemistry of compound 5b was different than the previous report. In contrast with the previous result and the coupling constant value (J=9.2Hz at 5 5.86 doublet proton) of compound 5b showed the synthesized compound 5b was cis- isomer. Thus, the compound 15 was well characterized by 1HNMR, 13 C-NMR, FTIR and HRMS spectral data. From the successful results, it can be indicated that previously unattain- able Lansiumamide A-phenylalanine amino acid hybrid and Alatamide (cis isomer)-phenylalanine amino acid hybrids were prepared by Suzuki coupling of N-((E)-2-bromo-2-phenylvinyl) cinnamamide/(E)-N-(2-lodo-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)vinyl) benzamide with n-Boc phenylalanine methyl ester. Conclusion In summary, a novel and efficient route for the preparation of Lansiumamide A-amino acid as well as Alatamide (cis isomer)- amino acid hybrids was developed. The research revealed the first synthesis of C-linked Lansiumamide A/Alatamide (cis- isomer)-Phenylalanine amino acid conjugates where both the natural products were linked to amino acid through C—C bond.
